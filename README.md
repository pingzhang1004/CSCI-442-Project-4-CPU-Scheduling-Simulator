# CSCI-442-Project-4-CPU-Scheduling-Simulator
##### using C

### Implemented FCFS, RR, SPN, PRIORITY, and MLFQ CPU scheduling algorithms to simulate a variety of possibly multi-threaded processes and calculated performance criteria from the simulations.
#### For instance: prompt> ./cpu-sim -a FCFS tests/input/input-1

####  1.  First Come, First Served (FCFS)
##### • Key point: Using queue data structure

#### 2. Round Robin (RR)
##### • Key point: Using queue data structure

#### 3. Shortest Process Next (SPN)
##### • Key point: Using stable_priority_queue

#### 4. Priority
##### • Key point: Using stable_priority_queue data structure

#### 5. Multi-Level Feedback Queues (MLFQ)
##### • Key Point: using an array of priorities queues data structure
